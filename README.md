# AdditiveSequenceAssembly
<p>This program was written in Assembly X86. </p>
<p> Defenition: A string contains an additive sequence if its digits can make a sequence of numbers in which every number is addition of previous two numbers.
 A valid string should contain at least three digit to make one additive sequence, and the first and second numbers of the string cannot have a leading zero.</p>
Given a string (inside the inc file) , the program's target is to find whether the string contains an additive sequence or not using recursion.
if the string is an additive sequence - the program will print the sequence, if not - the program will print "false".


 
 <p>you can see examples of the program's input and output in the "examples" png file that is added to this project(: </p>
