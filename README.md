# AdditiveSequenceAssembly
<a href="https://ibb.co/rtwFkpd"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Jdsmnp3/examples-1.png" alt="examples-1" border="0"></a>
<p>This program was written in Assembly X86. </p>
<p> <b>Defenition:</b> A string contains an additive sequence if its digits can make a sequence of numbers in which every number is addition of previous two numbers.
 A valid string should contain at least three digit to make one additive sequence, and the first and second numbers of the string cannot have a leading zero.</p>
<p> <b>What does the program do?</b> Given a string (inside the inc file) , the program's target is to find whether the string contains an additive sequence or not using recursion.
if the string is an additive sequence - the program will print the sequence, if not - the program will print "false".</p>


 
 <p>you can see examples of the program's input and output in the "examples" png file that is added to this project(: </p>
